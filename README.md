Senior Frontend Developer with 6+ years in SaaS, e-commerce, and startups. I build scalable, high-performance UIs with React and Vue.js — from design systems and real-time collaboration to data-heavy interfaces handling tens of thousands of records without breaking a sweat.

Shipped a 40+ component design system adopted company-wide, built real-time collaborative editing (think Google Docs-like experience), and delivered internal platforms and e-commerce solutions serving thousands of users.

All of my projects are under NDA, but I'm happy to discuss architecture decisions and technical details.
